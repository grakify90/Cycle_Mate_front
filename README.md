Todo: embed a nice GIF with a short preview of Cycle Mate

## Goals for this project
Cycle Mate is my portfolio project for the Codaisseur Academy, a bootcamp to become a fullstack developer. 
The goal was, in two weeks time, to: 
- Think of a concept that I would like to transform into an app
- Build a backend and frontend for this app 
- Apply technologies I've learned in the previous months
- But also apply new technologies that I have to explore on my own
- Make clear documentation to present my app (wireframe, DB diagram, user stories, project board, clear Git version control)
- Present it to my fellow students

## Technologies used
âœ¨ _Newly explored technology_

**Backend**
- Postgres Database
- Sequelize (âœ¨Many-to-many & âœ¨Multiple associations)
- Express JS
- Authorization with JSON Web Token
- âœ¨Nodemailer
- âœ¨Geocoding with LocationIQ API

**Frontend**
- React
- React-Redux
- Axios
- âœ¨MapBox for React 
- âœ¨Styled Components (CSS in JS library)
- âœ¨Firebase storage for image upload

## User stories
- As a visitor I want to feel welcome and know what Cycle Mate is about, and be able to sign up as a user
- As a user I want to see a list of cycle trips and be able to filter them
- As a user interested in a particular trip, I want to see the details of that trip
- As a user, I want to be able to join a trip that seems interesting to me, or undo this action if I change my mind
- As a user, I want to be able to ask questions and have conversations with other users
- As a user, I want to be able to create a topic on the message board
- As a user, I want to be able to manage my account, organize a new trip and view my personal cycle agenda (all the trips I will participate in)

## Git strategies
To make my work as transparent and correctable as possible, I:
